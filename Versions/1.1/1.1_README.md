Hello Salvu-fans. Thank you for waiting so long for this update, because it's finally here. Here, I'll say what the update consists of.

Feature no. 1: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS. YES. Finally, this command works very well and I don't think I really need to explain this. Just write /salvurps and try it out. We also added win streak with it so enjoy it, because that took lots of time.

Feature no. 2: salvuroast. Yes. It is pretty much what it says. Salvu will roast you. Currently, there isn't much options on roasts BUT it's still fun, so check it out but typing /salvuroast . 

I would like to thank SuchBlue LOT, because without him, this update wouldn't probably be possible (neither this bot would be possible).

Now, go enjoy Salvu!
