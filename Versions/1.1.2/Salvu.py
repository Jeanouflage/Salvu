There are many tourists that he can hang out with, but can also spend time alone, as they are all gone by 5pm! In his tiny house, he has mail, electricity, TVs and internet. His internet is faster than yours! He has recieved the highest honour in Malta because he takes care of his island. Salvu's house has everything it needs, except noise...
